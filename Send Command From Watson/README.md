Use the ino file for ESP32. Use 3 LEDs for 3 pins to test. 
RELAY written against one pin to indicate it is for relay, but LED will work for testing purpose. 

The bash scripts are for using from remote device (computer or Android with terminal app) to switch on or off the LED on ESP32.

All files need editing to replace the variables.
