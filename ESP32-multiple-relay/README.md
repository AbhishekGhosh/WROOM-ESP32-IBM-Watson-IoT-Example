Same setup as our code for single relay. [Check that single relay code to get started](https://github.com/AbhishekGhosh/WROOM-ESP32-IBM-Watson-IoT-Example/tree/master/Send%20Command%20From%20Watson). Anthony Elder was the original author of the single relay code. 

This set demonstrates how to control two relays with Watson IoT Platform connected ESP32 device with plain cURL commands. The cURL commands are supplied as bash scripts. Also, check the Fritzing file.
